# Z-Encoding & Sparse LSTM for Traffic Shockwave diagram

An anonymous implementation of a modular encoding method (“Z-encoding”) and a corresponding sparse LSTM architecture for learning traffic‐shockwave patterns.

## Description

This repository contains:

- **Z-Encoding**: A puzzle-based encoding technique that captures spatial, temporal, and adjacency features of traffic shockwave diagrams in a structured, modular vector.  
- **Sparse LSTM**: A recurrent neural network built with diagonal-block trainable weight matrices that leverage the physical meaning of each module to improve training efficiency, interpretability, and generalization.  
- **Experiments**: evaluation on the publicly available Seattle loop-detector dataset (2011).
